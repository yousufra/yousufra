### Hi, I'm Rahmat. I am a Full Stack Developer located in Hamilton, Canada. ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile where I have applications that I have built using a wide range of technologies such as: 

* Front End: React, Redux, Angular, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery
* Back End: Express, Koa, NodeJS, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, MongoDB, Mongoose, REST APIs
* Others: JavaScript(ES6), TypeScript, TDD/BDD, Jest, Cypress, JSON, Git, npm, JWT

I throughly enjoy how the Software Development industry is continuously changing which excites me as it intertwines with my enjoyment for continuos learning. I am always learning and taking courses on new technologies and implementing them on the job and my personal applications. I have obtained a wide range of skills from my experiences both technical and non-technical.

In my free time, I enjoy weight lifting ,running and spending time with friends and family. Also, I love to research and invest in the stock market, and can talk for days about this topic.
